Our results show a higher accuracy of the matching algorithm compared with that of existing approaches.","researchLine":"iot","slug":"adaptive_architecture"}},{"node":{"id":"b28a3536-7380-5cdf-9479-ca1df77c1fe2","url":null,"name":"Issues Detection in the Continuous Integration Pipeline","status":"active","summary":"ArchID is a tool for the identification and visualization of problems in software projects related to the design decisions, technologies and frameworks used in each context. It allows the detection of problematic files inside a project, according to predefined rules that must be hand-coded into queries that traverse a higher-level model representation of the source code.","researchLine":"comprehension","slug":"archid"}},{"node":{"id":"83811e72-2557-5db3-826f-2a999164678f","url":null,"name":"IoT Systems for Coal Mines","status":"active","summary":"An optimization methodology is proposed for the deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks to monitor gases in underground coal mining. The methodology addresses two objectives: minimizing deployment costs and maximizing WSN lifetime. The proposed methodology has been tested using two realistic case studies regarding mines in Boyac√°. The algorithm implementation produces instantaneous results for realistically sized networks, indicating that the methodology is computationally adequate.","researchLine":"iot","slug":"iot_mining"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
