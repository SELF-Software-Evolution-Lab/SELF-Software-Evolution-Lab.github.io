These changes (e.g. variations in the bandith consumption or new devices joining/leaving) may impact the Quality of Service (QoS) of the IoT system. A number of self-adaptation strategies for IoT architectures to better deal with these changes have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, they focus on isolated types of changes. We lack a comprehensive view of the trade-offs of each proposal and how they could be combined to cope with dynamic situations involving simultaneous types of events. The gist of this project is to develop an approach to identify different dynamic events and adapt the architecture to them. The adaptation mechanism may include software deployment patterns. This project is funded by the colombian government and its main case study is an IoT system for coal mines.","description":"IoT systems are subjected to changes in the dynamic environments they operate in.
