  "description": "On this lab we aim to resolve the following question: How to evolve and easily maintain already built software artifacts. Software systems evolution is a natural process, resulting from factors such as high operation costs, technical debt, inability to cope with incoming requirements and regulations, incompatibility with other systems, ceasing support by vendors, and lack of experts on out-of-date programming technologies. Software maintenance is essential to deal with the issues introduced by evolution. We target diverse kinds of systems such as 4GL, Web, API-based, microservice-based, and IoT applications.",
