These advances propose various challenges in software engineering in order to face the maintainability and support of current systems. The cases of software that become obsoleted by this accelerated process of evolution involves increasingly complex procedural challenges of migrations and updates. A clear example are reporting systems which are an essential support for companies. It is important to build solutions and tools that leverage efficient migration process. In this paper, we present a model-based approach to cover the migration scenario of reports from Crystal to Oracle Publisher. The approach relies on three pillars: i) a view with the results of a function point analysis that aims at facilitating planning task; ii) a structural view of the reports that allows developers to restructure them and see the migration progress status; and iii) the actual transformation from Crystal to Publisher. An evaluation of the approach on a real dataset shows their advantages in term of developers' productivity and report performance improvements.","members":[0],"publications":null,"researchLine":1,"period":"2018","industry":null,"demos":null}}}}
