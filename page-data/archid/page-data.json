It allows the detection of problematic files inside a project, according to predefined rules that must be hand-coded into queries that traverse a higher-level model representation of the source code.","description":"We propose a solution called ArchID (Architectural issues IDentification tool) that supports the reconstruction of software projects and the visualization of compliance to reference architectures. This solutions includes three main components. First, a rule conformance checker that analyzes the adherence to architectural rules and can also automatically create issues and bug entries in the Version Control System (VCS) of the project. Second, a component that uses evolutionary data to calculate possible hotspots in the projects, taking into different architectural and social metrics. Finally, we propose a visualization component that shows the projects with the prioritization made with the results of the previous components, that servers as a reconstruction of the architecture and a facilitator for decisions concerning the effort and future work on the projects analyzed. A validation of this solution was executed in the fall semester of 2019 with the students projects of a software development course in the Universidad de los Andes and a software project implemented by a software developing company.","members":[0,1,6,5],"publications":null,"researchLine":2,"period":"2018-present","industry":null,"demos":null}}}}
